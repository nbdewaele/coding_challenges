ruby 2.4.1

This is a collection of coding challenges taken from peers.  It is used to learn, stay sharp and help other people with their challenges.  The questions are all commented out and the code I am working with may or may not be commented out in various areas depending on how I am experimenting with it.

Some files may have multiple questions and questions that build on each other.  Each question will start with a question number.  Some might have titles.  Each question will be separated by a long string of octothorpes.

Don't expect completion of any of the problems.

If any of these questions belong to you and you want them removed, let me know and I will do so.

If you want to help and/or enjoy a good challenge, feel free to fork and/or share your changes, feedback, questions.
